In the `xsdforms` directory, there are xsd (XML Schema Definition) files that can be fed into [the service](https://xsd-forms.herokuapp.com) to generate web-forms and the javascripts for exporting form data in XML format.

The conversion is done via this [software package](https://github.com/davidmoten/xsd-forms).
